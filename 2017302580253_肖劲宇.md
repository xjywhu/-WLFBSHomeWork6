## P36
Why does TCP not perform a fast retransmission until it receives three redundant acks instead of the first?  
Because if the two packets after the i-th packet are out of order, for example, the order is i + 2, i + 1. A redundant ack will be generated, but there is no need to resend the packet i + 1 at this time, which wastes the throughput.  
Receiving three redundant acks is a trade-off between out of order retransmission and short time retransmission.  
## P40 Congestion Control Problem
a. [1,6] and [23,26]     
b. [6,16] and [17,22]  
c. Triple duplicate ACK because cwnd = ssthresh + 3*MSS = 24.  
d. Timeout. because the cwnd is 1.  
e. 32,because when cwnd<=32, it increased exponentially,when cwnd>32 it increased linearly.
f. 42/2=21
g. 29/2 = 14
h. during [1,6] 1+2+4+8+16+32= 63 <70  
during [1,7] 1+2+4+8+16+32+33=96>70  
So the 70th segment is sent in the 7th cycle.  
i. ssthresh = 8/2 = 4  
cwnd = ssthresh + 3MSS = 4+3 = 7  
j. Threshold is 21, and congestion window size is 4.  
k. 
round | packet number  
-|-
round 17 | 1 packet  
round 18 | 2 packets 
round 19 | 4 packets
round 20 | 8 packets  
round 21 | 16 packets  
round 22 | 21 packets(Threshold is 21)
So, the total number is 52.

## P45
a. The number of packets sent in a cycle is:   
n = (W/2) + (W/2 + 1) + (W/2 + 2) + ...... + (W) = (3/8w^2)+(3/4w)    
so L = 1/ n = 1/(3/8w^2+3/4w)    
b. if w is large enough, then 3/8(W^2) >> 3/4*(W),  
so L= 1/(3/8w^2) approximately.  w = (8/3L)^(1/2)  
Average rate = (w/(2RTT)+w/RTT)  
            = 0.75w/RTT  
            = 0.75*(8/3L)^(1/2)MSS/RTT  
            = (1.22*MSS)/(RTT*L^(1/2))
